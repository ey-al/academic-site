Welcome! I am a PhD candidate in Political Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). I study political violence, social media, and ethnic politics, with a focus on South Asia. My work uses survey experiments, relational interviews, and observational analyses of social media data. 

At MIT, I am affiliated with the GOV/LAB, Global Diversity Lab, and Security Studies Program. My research has been supported by Schmidt Futures' International Strategy Forum and various programs at MIT’s Center for International Studies.

Prior to starting at MIT, I was a research assistant at the Stimson Center in Washington, DC. I graduated with a BA in Public Policy Studies and South Asian Languages & Civilizations from the University of Chicago, where I competed on the varsity cross country and track teams. I have advanced proficiency in Urdu and Hindi, and basic knowledge of Arabic, Hebrew, and Spanish<a rel="me" href="https://mastodon.social/@hanfling">.</a>
